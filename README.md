# Employee Manager
A simple project to test out a few things I learned about Java, it's a command-line program that allows you to manipulate a list of employees in a fictional company, adding, removing and modifying their data.

Various concepts are used in the project, among them are:
- Object Oriented Programming
- HashMaps
- Separating UI from program logic
- Unit testing and test-first programming
- Saving and loading data from files

The UI is in portuguese, as I intend on showing the project to some people I know, and some of them can't speak english.

## Functionality
The program allows for the following:
- Adding employees to the company
- Displaying information about employees
- Altering job title and salary of added employees
- Displaying all employees in the company
- Removing employees from the list
- Loading employee list from a file
- Saving employee list to a file

## Build

Run `mvnw package` to create a jar in the `target/` folder
