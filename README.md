# Employee Manager
A simple project to test out a few things I learned about Java, it's a command-line program that allows you to manipulate a list of employees in a fictional company, adding, removing and modifying their data.

Various concepts are used in the project, among them are:
- Object Oriented Programming
- HashMaps
- Separating UI from program logic
- Unit testing and test-first programming
- Saving and loading data from files

The UI is in portuguese, as I intend on showing the project to some people I know, and some of them can't speak english.

## Funcionality
The project (when finished) will allow for the following:
- [DONE!] Adding employees to the company
- [DONE!] Displaying information about employees
- [DONE!] Altering job title and salary of added employees
- [DONE!] Displaying all employees in the company
- Removing employees from the company
- Loading employee list from a file
- Saving employee list to a file

Two other features I *may* add in the future:
- Encrypting the list when saving it (and decrypting to load)
- A password system. The password would be set the first time the program is run, and would be required to access it thereafter. After getting it wrong 3 times, you'd be able to reset it.
